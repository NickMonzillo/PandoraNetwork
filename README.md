# PandoraNetwork
A network visualization of Pandora's artist selection system using d3.js.

This is a representation of Pandora's network of artists. The data is taken in the following manner:
Start with "Four Year Strong" radio. Obtain 5 data points and then listen to the other radios.
Navigate to different radios based on the frequency of appearances. 
Thick lines represent a strong relationship between data points. (Each artist appeared in the other's radio.)
